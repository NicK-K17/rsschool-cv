## __About Me__

I have a higher education as an information technology engineer. Worked as a technical support specialist for several years.
Independently studied 3D graphics and the Unity development environment, currently I work in this field.
I can work long and hard on what I’m really interested in.
I like to study modern technologies and look for the best ways to solve emerging problems. I am ready to devote a lot of time to training and self-development. I adequately perceive objective criticism.
I have excellent communication skills, and know how to work in a team.
